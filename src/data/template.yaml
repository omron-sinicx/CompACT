overview: >
  We present Neural A*, a novel data-driven search
  method for path planning problems. Despite the
  recent increasing attention to data-driven path
  planning, a machine learning approach to search-
  based planning is still challenging due to the dis-
  crete nature of search algorithms. In this work, we
  reformulate a canonical A* search algorithm to be
  differentiable and couple it with a convolutional
  encoder to form an end-to-end trainable neural
  network planner. Neural A* solves a path plan-
  ning problem by (1) encoding a problem instance
  to a guidance map and (2) performing the differen-
  tiable A* search with the guidance map. By learn-
  ing to match the search results with ground-truth
  paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce
  a path consistent with the ground truth accurately
  and efficiently. Our extensive experiments con-
  firmed that Neural A* outperformed state-of-the-
  art data-driven planners in terms of the search
  optimality and efficiency trade-off, and further-
  more, successfully predicted realistic pedestrian
  paths by directly performing a search on natural
  image inputs.

method: >
  Neural A* consists of the combination of a fully-convolutional encoder
  and the differentiable A* module, and is trained as follows:
  (1) Given a problem instance (i.e., an environmental map annotated with start and goal points), the encoder transforms it
  into a scalar-valued map representation referred to as a guidance map; (2) The differentiable A* module then performs a
  search with the guidance map to output a search history and
  a resulting path; (3) The search history is compared against
  the ground-truth path of the input instance to derive a loss,
  which is back-propagated to train the encoder.
