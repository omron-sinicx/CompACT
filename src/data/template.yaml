overview: >
  We present Neural A*, a novel data-driven search
  method for path planning problems. Despite the
  recent increasing attention to data-driven path
  planning, a machine learning approach to search-
  based planning is still challenging due to the dis-
  crete nature of search algorithms. In this work, we
  reformulate a canonical A* search algorithm to be
  differentiable and couple it with a convolutional
  encoder to form an end-to-end trainable neural
  network planner. Neural A* solves a path plan-
  ning problem by (1) encoding a problem instance
  to a guidance map and (2) performing the differen-
  tiable A* search with the guidance map. By learn-
  ing to match the search results with ground-truth
  paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce
  a path consistent with the ground truth accurately
  and efficiently. Our extensive experiments con-
  firmed that Neural A* outperformed state-of-the-
  art data-driven planners in terms of the search
  optimality and efficiency trade-off, and further-
  more, successfully predicted realistic pedestrian
  paths by directly performing a search on natural
  image inputs.
