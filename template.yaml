overview: |
  This is a versatile template designed to satisfy your research project page needs, all while harnessing the power of **UIKit** and **React**. Built on the foundations of simplicity and flexibility, this template allows you to focus on expressing your ideas without the hassle of directly handling CSSâ€”thanks to customizable SASS variables.
  With markdown as your canvas and $\KaTeX$ for precise equations, crafting clear and engaging project page becomes effortless. Whether you're unraveling complex theories or presenting your findings, this template aims to support your scholarly endeavors with grace and ease.
  *Need to edit HTML directly?* Fear not! In addition to markdown, you can also directly write HTML with ease. Feel empowered to craft your content exactly as you envision it, whether through markdown's simplicity or the precision of HTML.

      You can access media files in `src/media/` using `assets/` paths

  - title: Markdown examples
    text: |
      Here's our demo text showcasing the power of markdown and KaTeX integration!
      Markdown allows you to easily format text using simple syntax.
      - **bold**
      - *italic*
      - `inline code`.

      You can also create headings of various levels:
      # Heading Level 1
      ## Heading Level 2
      ### Heading Level 3
      #### Heading Level 4
      Markdown allows you to create tables like the following:
      #### Motion Planning (MP) Dataset
      markdown version
      |Method|Opt|Exp|Hmean|
      |--|--|--|--|
      |BF| 65.8 (63.8, 68.0)| 44.1 (42.8, 45.5) | 44.8 (43.4, 46.3)|
      |WA*| 68.4 (66.5, 70.4)| 35.8 (34.5, 37.1) | 40.4 (39.0, 41.8)|
      |**Neural A*** | **87.7 (86.6, 88.9)**| 40.1 (38.9, 41.3) | 52.0 (50.7, 53.3)|

      Of course, you can also directly write tables in HTML if needed. For more details, refer to the [UIKit Table documentation](https://getuikit.com/docs/table).

  - title: KaTeX examples
    text: >
      $\KaTeX$ enables you to write mathematical expressions beautifully within your text (e.g. $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ ).
      $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
      $$ \int \oint \sum \prod $$
      $$ \begin{CD} A @>a>> B \\ @VbVV @AAcA \\ C @= D \end{CD} $$
      [KaTeX supports a wide range of mathematical symbols and equations](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html), ensuring your technical content is both clear and visually appealing.
      With markdown for text formatting and KaTeX for mathematical expressions, our template empowers you to communicate complex ideas effectively. Whether you're writing a scientific paper or a technical blog post, harnessing these tools will elevate your content and engage your readers.
